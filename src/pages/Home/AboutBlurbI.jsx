        What started out as a simple portfolio evolved into a full MERN-project.
        I included an admin portal through which I can enter new projects, new
        technologies I've applied, and even a personal blog where I can create
        journal entries that visitors can peruse*. My ambitions usually climb
        high when starting on a new project as it did with creating this
        portfolio. Before building any application, I ask myself, "what use can{" "}
        <em>I</em> get out of it?"
      </p>

        A portfolio is great for my employment prospects, but mostly from the
        point of view of the employer. I could have just used a simple stack,
        i.e., JS, CSS, & HTML, but why stop there? This portfolio leverages
        React's component-based, state-driven framework. Organizing and creating
        readable code is crucial regardless of context - personal or
        professional. For that reason, I decided that React would be a great use
        case for this project.

        I am meticulous when it comes to the overall front-end design and user
        experience - of course, within given time constraints. Having completed
        my full-stack software engineering program with General Assembly, I gave
        myself 5-days to create this portfolio.

        I've created a responsive webpage by taking a mobile-first approach. I
        aimed to showcase my CSS knowledge instead of relying on styling
        frameworks such as Material UI. I used native React elements where
        necessary, but kept to HTML to demonstrate this fundamental skill.
      </p>

        IDEs and CLI are a programmer's bread and butter. That's how I decided
        on the theme for this portfolio. If you're viewing this on desktop,
        you'll have noticed the Matrix-esque background on the edges of the
        page. Running binaries to signal the fact that this is a "programmer's
        website" may be cliche, but it just fit so well with the theme! How can
        I resist?
      </p>
      <p>
        This portfolio project - turned portfolio management system - turned
        blog - let me continue practicing test-driven development and best
        practices for writing clean code.

        I also saw this project as an opportunity to create another React
        project. I will say this, by the way: I LOVE React. Equally, I thrive in
        Express' backend playground. That said, I am pulled towards any
        opportunity involving MERN as a tech stack. But that won't stop me from
        learning new technologies! For me, part of the appeal of programming is
        it's continuous evolution. Developing proficencies is the game. Becoming
        proficient in development is the goal.

        Whenever I put down one project, I'm immediately eager to get my feet
        wet in another. I'd love to know what you'll be building next! Please
        get in touch and let's talk! Anyways, feel free to have a look around.
        Check out the repo for this project. And thanks for visiting! Look
        forward to hearing from you.
