        This simple website was created with React. Now, that may seem overkill,
        but I didn't want this to be "one-and-done" once I had a presentable
        portfolio page. Keeping in mind that I'll continue to develop more
        projects in the future and the need to track my learning experience,
        I've set up the foundation through this portfolio to do more. Now that
        this website is posted, I am in the process of building out RESTful APIs
        to add new projects and journal entries through my website.

        As a developer early into his career, I prioritize organization,
        step-wise project-building, and test-driven development. I aim to write
        clean and readable code, hitting the MVP, and Agile workflows for
        consistent productivity. In this portfolio project - turned portfolio
        management system - turned blog - I decided that React would be a great
        use case to execute these features.

        I am pulled towards any opportunity involving MERN as a tech stack. But
        that won't stop me from learning new technologies! For me, part of the
        appeal of programming is it's continuous evolution. Developing
        proficencies is the game. Becoming proficient in development is the
        goal.

        I am meticulous when it comes to the overall front-end design and user
        experience - of course, within given time constraints. Having completed
        my full-stack software engineering program with General Assembly, I gave
        myself 5-days to create this portfolio to continue creating more
        applications.

        For now, I've created a responsive webpage by taking a mobile-first
        approach. I aimed to showcase my CSS knowledge instead of relying on
        styling frameworks such as Material UI. I used native React elements
        where necessary, but kept to HTML to demonstrate this fundamental skill.

        IDEs and CLI are a programmer's bread and butter. That's how I decided
        on the theme for this portfolio. If you're viewing this on desktop,
        you'll have noticed the Matrix-esque background on the edges of the
        page. Running binaries to signal the fact that this is a "programmer's
        website" may be cliche, but it just fit so well with the theme! How can
        I resist?

        Whenever I put down one project, I'm immediately eager to get my feet
        wet in another. I'd love to know what you'll be building next! Please
        get in touch and let's talk! Anyways, feel free to have a look around.
        Check out the repo for this project. And thanks for visiting! Look
        forward to hearing from you.
