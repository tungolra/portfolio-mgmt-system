# My Portfolio Website

### About the Project

A portfolio website showcasing my tech stack, featured projects, toolings, and working examples of technologies I've used. While this is a React app, I've used React elements only when necessary to demonstrate foundational skills using pure CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Using a mobile-first approach, I created a responsive website for both desktop and mobile.

### Further iterations
- [x] Admin portal using token authorization 
- [x] Integrate RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on projects and skills. 
- [ ] Populate site with fetched data using Redux for state management. 
- [ ] Integrate blog page.
