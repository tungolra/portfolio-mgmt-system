# Ralph Tungol Portfolio

### About the Project

This webpage was completed in 5 days, containing only a presentable UI. It is a basic website that highlights my current projects, technologies used, and contact information. I continue to iterate over this project by adding additional functionality to make it into a portfolio management system. To organize various components and to set up the website to integrate RESTful APIs, React's component-based, state-driven framework was a good use-case for powering my site. I used Redux to optimize the application's performance, currently in my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tungolra/portfolio-mgmt-system/tree/development"> tree/development branch</a>.

I've created an admin portal using token-based authentication where I can add new projects, skills and create blog entries as I continue to build my portfolio and track my progress as a developer.

While this is a React app, I've used React elements only when necessary. The reason for this is to showcase my use of CSS and HTML - basic skills necessary for any developer. I've avoided the use of styling frameworks for this reason. Using a mobile-first approach, I created a responsive website for both desktop and mobile.

### Projects Component

The Projects component showcases a carousel to view a quick snapshot or gif of the core feature of each project. There are navigation buttons to view the next project.

### Project Details Page

When you reach the Projects component, users can access a details page where they'll be directed to the Project Details page. In it is a link to the GitHub repo, as well as a summary of the project and what I was responsible for when building the application.
