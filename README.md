### About the Project

This project was completed in 5 days. It is a basic website that highlights my current projects, technologies used, and contact information. To organize various components and to set up the website to integrate RESTful APIs, React's component-based, state-driven framework was a good use-case for powering my site.

I've created an admin portal using token-based authentication where I can add new projects and create blog entries as I continue to build my portfolio and track my progress as a developer.

While this is a React app, I've used React elements only when necessary. The reason for this is to showcase my use of CSS and HTML - basic skills necessary for any developer. I've avoided the use of styling frameworks for this reason. Using a mobile-first approach, I created a responsive website for both desktop and mobile.

### Projects Component

The Projects component showcases a carousel to view a quick snapshot or gif of the core feature of each project. There are navigation buttons to view the next project.

### Project Details Page

When you reach the Projects component, users can access a details page where they'll be directed to the Project Details page. In it is a link to the GitHub repo, as well as a summary of the project and what I was responsible for when building the application.

#### Skills Component

Here, I showcase the technologies I've used for all my projects. Organized by languages and technologies, I further specify the type of language/technology underneath.

### Footer Component

Either scrolling to the bottom of the page, selecting the Message box icon in the Nav Bar, or using the Sidebar Nav to get to any portion of the page, the Footer component directs the user to my Contact Me section. Linked within it is my CV, email, and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
